#loops are use to avoid coding again and again
#loops are used for code re-usability
#we can traverse the elements in the list ,dictionary,array or etc
#there are three types of the loops
#1:for loop: when iteration is finit,it is called per-tested loop
#2:while loop: when the iteration of the pre-tested loop
#3:do while loop: executes at least one when the execution of the program is not finit
